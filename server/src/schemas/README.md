# Schemas (Validation)

Use this directory for Zod schemas that validate incoming request bodies
and query parameters.

For example:

- `authSchemas.ts` for `/auth/init` and staff auth payloads.
- `vaultSchemas.ts` for `/vault/sync` and record access queries.
- `recoverySchemas.ts` for social recovery payloads.
