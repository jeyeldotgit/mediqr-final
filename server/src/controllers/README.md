# Controllers

This directory holds Express route handlers.

As the MediQR backend evolves, add feature-focused controllers here, for example:

- `authController.ts` for `/auth/init` and staff auth.
- `vaultController.ts` for `/vault/sync` and record access.
- `recoveryController.ts` for social recovery endpoints.
